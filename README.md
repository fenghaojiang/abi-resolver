# abi-resolver
resolve crypto event (with abi file or make request to etherscan) into readable json format  


## Description
The crypto data on chain is sometimes not so readable. Inspired by [Tenderly](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/)'s way of resolve and handle crypto on-chain data. 
I develop a set of tools kit to   
1. fetch abi file from [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) using Etherscan's APIs and save as file. 
2. resolve on-chain data to readable json format base according to given abi files
3. calculate crypto Event Hash and save as json file

Any kinds of suggestions are welcomed and PRs are appreciated
